# Emotions and Sentiments Detection

**This Project for Natural Language Processing /Data Science Track,Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) - Egypt**

   


Welcome to this notebook!
This project focuses on building a Sentiment Analysis system using English text comments extracted from social media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter. The goal is to apply data science and machine learning techniques to understand users' emotional expressions.

We make use of two diverse and rich datasets:

Sentiment140 Dataset â€“ 1 Million Tweets

YouTube Statistics Dataset

These datasets contain real-life expressions and interactions in different social contextsâ€”ranging from direct feedback, emotional sharing, to casual conversationsâ€”allowing us to explore how people express positive and negative sentiments.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal:
To develop a binary sentiment classification model that can identify whether a given English text comment expresses a positive or negative sentiment.

ðŸ“Œ This notebook covers:

-Data Collection & Exploratory Analysis

-Data Cleaning & Text Preprocessing

-Feature Representation using TF-IDF

-Training Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)

-Performance Evaluation & Comparison

-Testing on Real Comments

-Final Observations & Insights

This project represents a step toward leveraging AI to better understand human language and emotions â€” all within the real-world context of social media content analysis.
